# Hell Yeah Simulator Site

This is the first site i ever made in HTML while learning it at school. I did it just for fun and made it really badly and I like it as it is. 
The site has background music when loaded, so on chromium-based browser it doesn't work, or at least, i couldn't figure how to enable it. 
On firefox you have to click on the taskbar icon and allow it. Then you reload the page and it should work. 
This site isn't affiliated or associated with the official _Hell Yeah Simulator_ game, nor the official developer of the game. 
Have fun!
